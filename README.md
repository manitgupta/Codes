# Codes
General Stuff

C++ Custom Snippets are some Sublime Text Snippets I wrote to improve workflow :D

Conventions I follow in my code:

\#define _DEBUG : Used for debugging. Surrounds the main() function in several files which could be used for linking.

\#define _FUNCDG : Used for printing function outputs while debuggings. Comment this to prevent unecesarry output.

Quick Tips:

Some Files use the C++11 standard. Use flag -std=C++11 for compiling.

Note to self: Press **Alt+Shift+t** to open a terminal window in the current working directory.

###Use the Git Plugin within sublime text
	
	ctrl + shift + p, TYPE git add ctrl + shift + p, TYPE quick, THEN type message ctrl + shift + p and press enter, TYPE push 

To add and commit all in one step, just skip straight to the Quick Commit command. 
That will stage and commit for you. Itâ€™s the equivalent of git commit -am 'im staging and committing!'
