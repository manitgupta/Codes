# Codes
General Stuff

Hey! 
Multipurpose repository for pushing all sorts of code I write.

Conventions I follow in my code:

#define _DEBUG : Used for debugging. Surrounds the main() function in several files which could be used for linking.

#define _FUNCDG : Used for printing function outputs while debuggings. Comment this to prevent unecesarry output.
