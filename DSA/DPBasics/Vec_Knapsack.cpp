// Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
// In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated
// with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset
// of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the
// complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

//Value of the solution to i items either include ith item, in which case it is vi plus a subproblem solution 
// for (i - 1) items and the weight excluding wi, or does not include ith item, in which case it is a subproblem's 
// solution for (i - 1) items and the same weight. That is, if the thief picks item i, thief takes vi value, and thief can 
// choose from items w - wi, and get c[i - 1, w - wi] additional value. On other hand, if thief decides not to take item i, 
// thief can choose from item 1,2, . . . , i- 1 upto the weight limit w, and get c[i - 1, w] value. The better of these two 
// choices should be made.
