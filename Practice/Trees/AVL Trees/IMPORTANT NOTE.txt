Always Remember That First Standard BST insertions and deletions are done
and after that Rotations are done.

This means one thing is for sure, first half of both Insert and Delete of AVL Trees will have the exact same code
as the BST Insert and Delete. The next part will be for the rotations.


AVL Insert/Delete:
	First: 	Perform BST Insert/Delete
	Second: Update the Height of Ancestor/Current Nodes
	Third: 	Write conditions for rotations for the 4 possible cases.
